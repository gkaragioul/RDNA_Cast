# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.26] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Assisted updater now checks releases from the canonical `georgekgr12/RDNA_Cast` endpoint.
- Shared remote fetches now follow HTTP redirects, preventing GitHub owner or repository rename redirects from breaking update checks.
- Installer, About, README, and changelog links now point at `georgekgr12/RDNA_Cast`.
- AMD-lite builds now disable `obs-websocket` while keeping the browser websocket API interface needed by `obs-browser`.

## [0.7.25] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- File > Exit now uses the RDNA Cast force-close path instead of close-to-tray, so explicit exit commands shut the app down.
- Added a one-time dock layout recovery to reset distorted saved layouts caused by repeated close-to-tray attempts.
- Stream and recording timers now use actual elapsed monotonic time instead of status refresh ticks.
- VRAM usage now prefers Windows GPU Adapter Memory counters for system-wide dedicated GPU memory usage.

## [0.7.24] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Added a PC Specs & Auto Optimize section to Settings > Output that shows CPU, memory, AMD GPU generation/VRAM, output resolution/FPS, and recording drive free space.
- Added a one-button optimizer that saves low-impact streaming and recording settings using available AMD hardware encoders, Speed preset, platform-friendly bitrate, AAC audio, hybrid MP4 recording, and High Quality / Medium File Size recording.

## [0.7.23] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Restored YouTube account login in AMD Lite builds without embedding any Google account credentials.
- Added a local-only YouTube OAuth client credential prompt for builds that do not ship with shared app OAuth credentials.

## [0.7.22] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- The main controls Exit button now performs a real app shutdown instead of following close-to-tray behavior.
- Floating dock windows, including chat and browser docks, now hide with the main window when RDNA Cast is minimized or sent to tray and restore with it.
- AMD streaming presets now default to Speed for lower game-time encoder overhead.

## [0.7.21] — 2026-05-16

### Removed
- Removed the status overlay/HUD feature entirely after testing showed external overlay windows could still cause game lag on the target system.
- Removed overlay settings, overlay window code, documentation screenshot, config defaults, and replay-save overlay notifications.

## [0.7.20] — 2026-05-16

### Changed
- Replaced the old translucent status overlay system with a persistent opaque performance HUD.
- Removed overlay opacity and game-safe auto-hide controls; the HUD now uses a small solid badge to reduce compositor overhead while staying visible during active stream, recording, or replay states.

## [0.7.19] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- Game-safe status overlay mode that auto-hides the translucent overlay between status notifications to reduce gameplay stutter.

### Changed
- Status overlay now avoids redundant reposition, raise, and repaint work when status values have not changed.

## [0.7.18] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Status overlay now drops `REC` immediately when recording stops while replay buffer remains active.

## [0.7.17] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Replay buffer `SAVE` overlay notification now triggers from the saved event, so hotkeys, tray actions, frontend calls, and the UI button all behave the same.

## [0.7.16] — 2026-05-16

### Changed
- Status overlay now combines active stream, recording, and replay buffer states instead of hiding replay behind recording or streaming.

## [0.7.15] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Status overlay no longer appears while idle; it only shows during streaming, recording, or active replay buffer use.

## [0.7.14] — 2026-05-16

### Changed
- Status overlay settings now flash `READY` when applied, so placement and visibility can be confirmed immediately.

## [0.7.13] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- Lightweight status overlay with corner placement and opacity controls under Settings → General.
- Overlay status flashes for stream, recording, replay buffer, hotkey, and main control actions.

### Changed
- Assisted updater now checks releases from `karagioules/RDNA_Cast`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-04

### Changed — Rebrand
- **Project rebranded from `GK OBS Lite AMD Edition` to `RDNA Cast`** for trademark compliance
- New About dialog text, window title, and installer branding
- New product name in all user-facing strings (en-US.ini)
- Added explicit non-affiliation disclaimer to README, About dialog, and installer license notice — clarifies independence from AMD and the OBS Project
- Added `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` aggregating all bundled-library licenses
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md`

### Migrated
- App config directory renamed from `%APPDATA%\obs-studio` to `%APPDATA%\rdnacast`. Existing v0.6.x users get a one-time auto-migration on first launch (the old folder is renamed; settings, scenes, profiles, hotkeys are preserved). Same for portable installs.
- Inno Setup AppId is unchanged so existing v0.6.x users get a clean in-place upgrade. Old `GK_OBS_Lite_AMD` shortcuts are removed by the installer.

## [0.6.7] — 2026-05-04

### Removed
- Stripped upstream OBS Help menu entries: Help Portal, Website, Discord, What's New, Release Notes, Check for Updates (the latter was already disabled, just hidden from menu now). Help menu now: Log Files, Crash Logs, Repair, Restart Safe, About.

### Fixed
- `build.bat`: `vswhere` now uses `-products *` to detect VS2022 BuildTools (was only matching Community/Pro)
- `cmake/common/versionconfig.cmake`: strip leading `v` from git tags before extracting `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for `project(VERSION ...)`

## [0.6.6] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Configurable preview FPS setting** — Preview dropdown with 5 options: Full (60), Smooth (30, default), Balanced (20), Efficient (15), Minimal (10). Lower preview FPS frees CPU/GPU for the game.

## [0.6.5] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- Tray notifications for hotkey-triggered actions

## [0.6.4] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Settings dialog crash
- YouTube chat dock position not persisting

## [0.6.3] — 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Optimized streaming panel rendering
- Improved preview FPS throttling

## [0.6.2] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- YouTube Connect dock for stream management
- Browser sources (build with `-DENABLE_BROWSER=ON`)
- Persistent UI/dock settings across restarts

## [0.6.0] — earlier 2026

### Added
- Custom assisted-update system pulling from GitHub Releases
- Tray controls (Stream, Record, Replay Buffer, Save Replay, Exit)
- About dialog with GPLv2-or-later, MIT additions, and bundled-library attribution

## [0.5.0] — initial public release

### Added
- AMD-only build (AMF HEVC default encoder)
- AMD AMF encoder fixes (AV1 filler data, VBV cap, pre-analysis disabled, HQCBR filler data)
- Stripped non-AMD plugins (NVENC, QSV, browser, websocket, etc.)
- Portable mode by default
- Close-to-tray behavior
- Inno Setup installer with custom branding
