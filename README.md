"AMD", "Radeon", and "RDNA" are trademarks of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., used here only descriptively to indicate target hardware compatibility.

RDNA Cast is a fork of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com), redistributed under the GNU General Public License v2.0. See [COPYING](COPYING) for the full GPL text and [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md) for bundled-library licenses.

## What is this?

RDNA Cast is a **lightweight fork of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) 31.0.3**, built exclusively for **AMD hardware on Windows**. It strips out everything you don't need, optimizes what's left for AMD Zen 3+ CPUs and RDNA GPUs, and **fixes real AMD encoder bugs** that cause bitrate spikes and drops during streaming.

## Performance

| Metric | Stock OBS 31.0.3 | RDNA Cast |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **RAM (idle)** | ~300-400 MB | **~52 MB** |
| **Threads** | ~50-60 | **~15** |
| **Plugin DLLs** | ~30+ | **12** |
| **Disk size** | ~500+ MB | **139 MB** (installer) |
| **Preview GPU load** | Full refresh rate (165 FPS) | **~40 FPS** (throttled) |
| **Gaming FPS impact** | 20-30 FPS loss reported | **Significantly reduced** |

## Features

### Core
- **AMD-first encoder defaults** — AMF HEVC is the default encoder. Dropdown: AMD AV1 > HEVC > H.264 > x264 fallback
- **11 plugins** instead of 36 — only what you need for streaming and recording
- **AVX2 + /favor:AMD64 compiler optimizations** — built for Zen 3+ instruction scheduling
- **D3D11-only rendering** — AMD's best-optimized driver path on Windows

### Gaming-Friendly
- **Preview throttled to ~40 FPS** — GPU renders preview every 4th frame instead of 165 FPS. Encoder still gets every frame at full quality
- **Pre-analysis disabled** — eliminates the AMF pre-encode pass that steals GPU cycles from your game
- **Reduced GPU encode textures** (10 → 6) — frees VRAM for game textures
- **Reduced async frame cache** (30 → 12) — less memory pressure
- **No profiler overhead** in the render loop

### UX
- **Portable by default** — settings, scenes, profiles live next to the executable
- **Close-to-tray** — X minimizes to system tray (like Steam/AMD Adrenalin). Recording keeps running
- **Tray controls** — right-click for Stream, Record, Replay Buffer, Save Replay, Exit
- **Built-in assisted updater** — Help → Check for Updates fetches the latest installer from GitHub Releases
- **About dialog** with GPLv2-or-later, MIT additions, and bundled-library notices
- **Windows installer** with custom branding via Inno Setup

### AMD Encoder Fixes

These fixes address long-standing AMD AMF issues reported across [OBS #12013](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/12013), [OBS #12512](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/12512), [AMF #465](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF/issues/465), and [AMF #323](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF/issues/323):

| Fix | Problem | Solution |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **AV1 filler data bug** | Stock OBS compares AV1 rate control against H.264 enum constants — filler data never activates for AV1 CBR. Causes bitrate drops to 0 on static scenes. | Use correct `AMF_VIDEO_ENCODER_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_METHOD_CBR` enum |
| **VBV buffer too large** | Stock OBS sets VBV = 1 full second of bitrate, allowing spikes up to ~2x target before correction | VBV = 500ms (`bitrate / 2`) — cuts maximum spike in half |
| **Startup encoder overload** | H.264 pre-analysis (`PREENCODE_ENABLE`) consumes first GOP, causing 2-3 second frame drops at stream start | Pre-analysis disabled |
| **HQCBR filler data** | High Quality CBR mode didn't enable filler data on any codec | Filler data now enabled for both CBR and HQCBR on H.264, HEVC, and AV1 |

## Target Hardware

| Component | Tested On |
|-----------|-----------|
| **CPU** | AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D (Zen 3, 8C/16T) |
| **GPU** | AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT (RDNA 4) |
| **RAM** | 32GB DDR4 |
| **OS** | Windows 11 Pro |

Any AMD system with a Zen 2+ CPU and RDNA+ GPU should work. AVX2 required (all Zen CPUs support this).

## What's Removed

### Non-AMD Encoders
- `obs-nvenc` — NVIDIA GPU encoder
- `obs-qsv11` — Intel Quick Sync Video
- `nv-filters` — NVIDIA GPU filters

### Non-Windows Platform Code
- `libobs-opengl`, `libobs-metal`, all macOS/Linux/BSD plugins

### Heavyweight Optional Plugins
- `obs-browser` — Chromium (can be re-enabled with `-DENABLE_BROWSER=ON`)
- `obs-websocket`, `obs-webrtc`, `vlc-video`, `decklink`, `aja`, `obs-vst`, `text-freetype2`, `obs-libfdk`
- Lua/Python scripting, frontend-tools plugin

### What Remains (11 core plugins)

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `obs-ffmpeg` | FFmpeg muxing + **AMF hardware encoder** (H.264, HEVC, AV1) |
| `obs-x264` | Software H.264 fallback |
| `obs-filters` | Video/audio filters |
| `obs-transitions` | Scene transitions |
| `obs-outputs` | RTMP, SRT, RIST streaming + recording |
| `obs-text` | Windows text rendering |
| `image-source` | Image/slideshow sources |
| `rtmp-services` | Streaming service configs (Twitch, YouTube, etc.) |
| `win-capture` | Window, game, and monitor capture |
| `win-dshow` | Webcams and capture cards (DirectShow) |
| `win-wasapi` | Windows audio capture/output |

## Building

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (Community or BuildTools) with **Desktop development with C++** workload + ATL
- CMake 3.28+
- Git
- Inno Setup 6 (for installer, optional)

### Quick Build
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/karagioules/RDNA_Cast.git
cd RDNA_Cast
cmake --preset amd-lite-x64
cmake --build build_amd_lite --config RelWithDebInfo --parallel
```

### With Browser Source
```cmd
cmake --preset amd-lite-x64 -DENABLE_BROWSER=ON -DENABLE_WEBSOCKET=ON
cmake --build build_amd_lite --config RelWithDebInfo --parallel
```

### Full Build + Installer
Run `build.bat` — handles CMake configure, build, and Inno Setup packaging in one step.

## How It Works

All RDNA Cast changes are gated behind the `OBS_AMD_LITE` CMake flag and `#ifdef OBS_AMD_LITE` preprocessor guards. Building without the flag produces stock OBS Studio. This makes upstream merges from [obsproject/obs-studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) straightforward.
